## 3. Existent Methods

* core.ex - exclusion
* core.ma - trimmed
* core.dp - double weighting

## 4. What we propose

We describe here the step-by-step core method calculations with its formula. We bring up why this method is better than the other theoretically.

Include the implementation's details.

We provide database (IBGE) to users.

## 5. Application

We show with real data, plots and measurements why this method outperforms the others.

## 6. Usage

We provide a vignette-like how to operate the package.
