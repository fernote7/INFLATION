#' @title An R package providing tools for those who want to figure out the core inflation of their series.
#'
#'
#' @description The INFLATION package provides tools that allow its user to better understand core inflation.
#'
#' The package provides a set of functions that compute the core inflation based on items that are part of
#' an inflation index. Currently, the package allows for four different core inflation computations
#' methods: trimmed means, exclusion, double weighting and triple filter. The first three are well known by the
#' public. The latter is a method we developped that we believe is better as measure.
#'
#'
#'
#' @note The authors would like to thank the support by the Getulio
#' Vargas Foundation (FGV) and make it clear that all
#' data in the package is in public domain. We reaffirm that INFLATION
#' is mainly intended for academic usage.
